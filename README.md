# About

A landing page to practice basic HTML and CSS.

This is a lesson from the Foundations Course of [The Odin Project](http://theodingproject.com).

# Overview

For this project, a [layout](#given-layout) was given to be implemented using HTML + CSS. The main goal was to practice Flexbox layout and other basic concepts.

##### Given layout:

# Features

I made the layout responsive and added some css animations to
spice up the design a bit more (a media query was included to handle user's reduced motion preference).

I also used some Javascript to handle animations on scroll and to make buttons and images open urls on click (I thought this was easier than include anchor tags around img tags, adding a bit of extra complexity to the design).

# Content

The content of this landing page is displaying some images of the universe. The credits are in the title attribute of each image and by clicking the image you will be redirected to the original source with additional informations.
